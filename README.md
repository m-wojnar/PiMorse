# PiMorse

PiMorse is Python script that can be used to translate your message into Morse code with Raspberry Pi

## Construction

To test this program I used Raspberry Pi Zero W, a blue LED connected to pin 21 (in BCM mode) and GND pin through 100 Ohm resistor. **Remember that you do this on your own risk! If you connect something incorrectly, you can burn your device or LED!**

## Instruction

If you want to use this program, you have to use Raspberry Pi (I have Raspberry Pi Zero W, other versions might be incompatible!). Connect your device to the LED (remember about appropriate resistor!) and run the program using Python3.
